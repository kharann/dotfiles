If the formatter is working, but doesn't seem to working _properly_:
1. Take a look at the `.jsbeautifyrc` [settings help](https://github.com/HookyQR/VSCodeBeautify/blob/master/Settings.md) file.
2. It may be an issue with `js-beautify` itself. Have a look at the [issues](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify/issues) for that repo.

If this isn't the problem, go ahead and log an issue. Or better yet, if you know how to fix the problem, submit a pull request.
